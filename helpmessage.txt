`!rickme` for an inspirational quote.

`!purge` to bring down the wrath of the Firelord on a foe.

`!class [classname]` to get your class. When your class is set, your message will be deleted, so you know I processed you.

I understand these classes: dk, druid, hunter, mage, monk, paladin, priest, rogue, shaman, warlock, warrior

`!class remove` gets rid of your class colour.

You can do some reddit-y things: 

* `!hot` `!new` `!rising` get hot, new or rising posts from reddit.
* `!sticky` and `!sticky bottom` fetch links to the stickies. `!sticky bottom` is hilarious.

If you are *desperate* you can attempt to summon aphoenix with `!aphoenix`. Overuse of this will result in displeasure and the ability to do this may be revoked.
