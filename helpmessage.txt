`!rickme` for an inspirational quote.

`!purge` to bring down the wrath of the Firelord on a foe.

`!class classname` to get your class. When your class is set, your message will be deleted, so you know I processed you.

I understand these classes: dk, druid, hunter, mage, monk, paladin, priest, rogue, shaman, warlock, warrior

`!class remove` gets rid of your class colour.

`!8ball question` will make me prognosticate for you.

You can do some reddit-y things: 

* `!hot` `!new` `!rising` `!controversial` gets posts of that type from the /r/wow.
* `!sticky` and `!sticky bottom` fetch links to the stickies. `!sticky bottom` is hilarious.

The `!aphoenix` command is currently not working until aphoenix fixes his phone or buys a new one.
